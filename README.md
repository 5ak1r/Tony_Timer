# Tony Timer


Welcome to Tony Timer! This is a fun little Discord bot I made for my friend Toby who never gets online when he says he will.

It's very easy to use with only three commands as of right now. To use these commands you simply write them into a channel on your Discord server that the bot can see.

Current Supported Commands
--------------------------

!hoppingon - start the timer

!on - stop the timer and display the time taken in seconds

!busy - stop the timer if there is one; display a message about him not getting on tonight ðŸ˜­

!isitcominghome - humourous, responds in the language of the winning country

!average - calculates and displays the average time it has taken for Tony to get online

!busycount - displays the number of times the !busy command has been called

!help - displays all current commands and what they do

CHANGELOG
=========

v1.1 - Added new command
------------------------

!isitcominghome - humourous, responds in the language of the winning country

v1.2 - Database and Averages!
-----------------------------

The number of !busy times as well as the times taken to return are now stored in a simple key-value replit database. As of right now, the database resets every time the bot does. This is not intentional and will be removed when the bot is finished. Two new commands!

!average - calculates and displays the average time it has taken for Tony to get online

!busycount - displays the number of times the !busy command has been called

!help - displays all current commands and what they do

v1.3 - Server-wide functionality
--------------------------------

You can now use Tony Timer in all channels of the server and all data is accessible regardless of the channel the command is sent in
