# Tony Timer


Welcome to Tony Timer! This is a fun little Discord bot I made for my friend Toby who never gets online when he says he will.

It's very easy to use with only three commands as of right now. To use these commands you simply write them into a channel on your Discord server that the bot can see.

!gettingon - start the timer
!on - stop the timer and display the time taken in seconds
!busy - stop the timer, he's not getting on tonight ðŸ˜­
